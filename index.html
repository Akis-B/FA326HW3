    <h2>Explaining how the DVD website works!</h2>

      </a>
    </h4>

    <div class="section">
      The website runs on three main components: html, javascript and css.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>HTML</h4>
      It controls the architecture of the website. I can see that the designer wanted the website to scale to device screen size. The html file reveals that floating DVD logo is actually drawn using code. For example, this is what the code to write the D looks like:

      <pre class="code-box"><code>
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 187 83" width="200"&gt;
&lt;path d="M129 10h18s22-1 21 10c0 18-27 17-27 17l5-23h-18l-8 33h18s18 1 33-7 ..." /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
      </code></pre>

      The "D":
      <svg viewBox="0 0 187 83" width="200">
        <path d="M129 10h18s22-1 21 10c0 18-27 17-27 17l5-23h-18l-8 33h18s18 1 33-7 ..."/>
      </svg>

      Fun HTML fact: if the code doesn't work properly you'll get text saying "This would normally be a DVD logo that moves around the screen reflecting off every wall and changing colour each time. Unfortunately, I need JavaScript to make it work so you'll just have to imagine it doing that. Sorry… :("
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h4>JavaScript</h4>
      The JavaScript makes the logo move smoothly across the screen by continuously updating its position with each animation frame. It checks for collisions with the edges of the browser window and, when the logo hits a wall, it reverses direction so it “bounces” back. Each time a collision happens, the script also changes the color of the logo. The code that is run to change the logo's color looks like:

      <pre class="code-box"><code>
logo.style.fill = `rgb(${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255})`;
      </code></pre>

      Fun JavaScript fact: The color of the logo is chosen using the Math.random() function. Meaning that there is no pattern concerning the color change of the logo and it is truly random.

    <div class="section">
      <h4>CSS</h4>
      The CSS code in this case does not add anything that extra. It just determines colors, font, sizes, etc. As we all know from codecademy!
