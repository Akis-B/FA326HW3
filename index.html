  <h2>Explaining how the DVD website works!</h2>
    <h4>
        <a href="https://tilde.club/~ve3zsh/dvd/index.html" style="color:blue;">

    </h4>
    <h3>
        Structure
    </h3>
    <div>
        The website runs on three main components: html, javascript and css <br> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>HTML</h4>
      
        It controls the architecture of the website. <br>
        I can see that the designer wanted the website to scale to device screen size <br>
        The html file reveals that floating DVD logo is actually Drawn using code. <br>
        For example, this is what the code to write the D looks like <br>
      
        <pre class="code-box"><code>
        &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 187 83" width="200"&gt;
        &lt;path d="M129 10h18s22-1 21 10c0 18-27 17-27 17l5-23h-18l-8 33h18s18 1 33-7 ..." /&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <br>The "D"<br>
        <svg viewBox="0 0 187 83" width="200">
        <path d="M129 10h18s22-1 21 10c0 18-27 17-27 17l5-23h-18l-8 33h18s18 1 33-7 ..."/>
        </svg> <br>

        Fun HTML fact: if the code doesn't work properly you'll get text saying <br>
          "This would normally be a DVD logo that moves around the screen <br>
          reflecting off every wall and changing colour each time. Unfortunately,<br>
          I need JavaScript to make it work so you'll just have to imagine it <br>
          doing that. Sorry… :(" <br>
    </div>
  
    <div>
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>

        The JavaScript makes the logo move smoothly across the screen by continuously updating its position with each animation frame <br>
        It checks for collisions with the edges of the browser window and, when the logo hits a wall, it reverses direction so it “bounces” back <br>
        Each time a collision happens, the script also changes the color of the logo <br>
        The code that is run to change the logo's color look like: <br>
      
        <pre class="code-box"><code>
        logo.style.fill = `rgb(${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255})`;
        </code></pre>

        Fun JavaScript fact: The color of the logo is chosen using the Math.random() function <br>
          Meanin that there is no pattern concerning the color change of the logo <br>
          and it is trully radom. <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>CSS</h4>

        The CSS code in this case does not anything that extra. <br>
        It just determines colors, font, sizes, etc. <br>
        As we all know from codecademy!<br>
